#Teflon
Teflon is a build systemn that seeks to solve the limited nature of polymer construction, streamline the development process and optimize the final product. Through a stepped build system Teflon allows for programming in jade or html for templating; es6 for javascript and sass/scss for CSS. Each of these different technologies are used dynamically and require no configuring by the user inorder to be taken advantage of. Teflon also comes with the ability to start a dev server and watch files rebuilding only what changes. The final build is hyper optimized.

## How to use
Teflon is designed to be incredibly easy to use, the intuitive file structure combined with the dynamic file processing results in a quickstart and easy use.
